The pages that follow contain technical reference information on the Uniswap SDK.

The SDK is written in TypeScript, has a robust test suite, performs arbitrary precision arithmetic,
and supports rounding to significant digits or fixed decimal places.
The principal exports of the SDK are _entities_: classes that contain initialization and validation checks,
necessary data fields, and helper functions.

## Code
